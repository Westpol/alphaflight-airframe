# Alphaflight Airframe

This repository contains the CAD files and design notes for an experimental
fixed-wing FPV airframe intended to be flown with the Alphaflight firmware.
The long-term goal is fully autonomous flight.

This is a personal project and primarily serves as documentation of the design
process.

## Software used

The airframe is designed using FreeCAD (free and open-source).
Current version in use: **1.0.2**

## Basic idea

The current concept is a fixed-wing aircraft without a traditional fuselage.
Instead, carbon fiber tubes connect the wing to the tail section.

The motor will be mounted slightly above the wing. A key design constraint is
hand-launch safety: the propeller must stay clear of any area where a hand might
be placed during launch, as well as everything behind that area.

To achieve this, the motor is mounted above the wing and the airframe will
include skids and a launch handle approximately 10 cm below the wing, ensuring
sufficient clearance from the propeller.

The aircraft will feature:
- Two ailerons for roll control
- One elevator for pitch control

A rudder may be added later, but this is not decided yet.
